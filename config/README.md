# Configuration

Current config options:
- *autoSaveInterval*: _float_. Default is `1.0`.  Sets the minimum time for an autosave interval.  Auto-save only happens when an attribute is being edited.
- *map*: _object_. The map is an object whose keys are _meta object names_.  Each key points to an object whose keys are the _attribute names_ which should be editable using the CodeEditor visualizer.
